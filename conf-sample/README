This directory contains a sample of the default configuration of the
loom-perl/conf directory. The files "sloop" and "loom" are created by
loom::attempt-loom-server-startup, but they are never overwritten, so
you can configure them by hand by doing:

  cd .../loom
  mkdir -p loom-perl/data/conf
  cp conf-sample/sloop loom-perl/data/conf/
  cp conf-sample/loom loom-perl/data/conf/

Then edit loom-perl/data/conf/sloop, which configures the Loom web
server. For development on a machine with more than one developer,
you'll want to assign a different "host_port" value to each developer,
different from the default of 8286.

loom-perl/data/conf/loom configures the loom server's web site. I
don't know much about it except that Patrick Chkoreff told me to set
it up how I did.
