cl-loom is a Common Lisp library for accessing the Loom.cc server.

If you wish to use it to simply access https://loom.cc/, you won't
need the loom-perl submodule. If you want to run your own local Loom
module, however, you should do "git submodule init; git submodule
update" in a shell in this directory to load the Loom perl code (or
use the "git-submodule-init" script). It currently works with v110 of
the Loom code. Patrick Chkoreff has since reorganized Loom, but I
haven't yes updated the library to work with the new Loom code.
